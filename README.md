In a development of a computer game software, you are required to develop several  classes to represent different type of robots. The types of robots you have are BlueBot,  RedBot, and GreenBot. All robots can change weapon, attack enemy, and move around.  However, the 3 types of robots move around in its own way. The robots can attack its enemy using different type of weapon depending on the  characteristics of the enemy. If the enemy has armor greater than 50 points, the robot  should use Laser. If the armor is between 20 and 50 points, Rifle is good enough. If the  armor is less than 20 points, Spear is the one to pick. The choice of weapon should  also consider the speed of the enemy. If the enemyâ€™s speed is faster than 60km/h,  Spear will not yield any damage. If the enemy move faster than 120km/h, the only  effective weapon will be Laser.
